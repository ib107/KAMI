# KAMI - Arthritis Treatment System 
My final-year Engineering Design Project (EDP/Capstone) focused on developing a therapeutic treatment system for individuals impacted by arthritis. KAMI is an innovative therapeutic system combining wearable technology and intuitive monitoring to offer effective relief for Rheumatoid Arthritis, empowering users with easy, portable care.

Our team secured the top position for our project at Engineering Day in the Biomedical Engineering field and received recognition from the Global Undergraduate Awards in the Highly Commendable category for our outstanding work.

## Description 
KAMI is an integrated therapeutic system with the aim to provide relief for middle-aged women who are affected by Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The system consists of a wearable glove that provides thermotherapy and vibration therapy using a heating pad and vibration motors, and was accompanied with an iOS app that serves as a monitoring user interface. The system allows for a portable, intuitive, effective and user-friendly solution for those affected by RA.

The app utilizes Firebase for its adaptable Realtime Database and React Native frameworks for its efficient and flexible component-based architecture with various open-source libraries that are programmed using JavaScript.
